Specifically, developers can only issue debt to refinance outstanding foreign-currency liabilities in the next 12 months, a move intended to cool land market auctions in the country.\nThe recent tightening in overseas funding channels, mainly the offshore US dollar credit market, has followed the reining in of the trust financing channel in the onshore market, another major source of funding channel for the capital-intensive industry.\nThis commentary provides a high level overview of the recent economic environment, and is for information purposes only. It is a marketing communication and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to any reader of this content to buy or sell investments nor should it be regarded as investment research. It has not been prepared in accordance with legal requirements designed to promote the independence of investment research and is not subject to any prohibition on dealing ahead of its dissemination.

Any forecast, projection or target where provided is indicative only and is not guaranteed in any way. HSBC Global Asset Management accepts no liability for any failure to meet such forecast, projection or target.\nThe introduction of a new benchmark interest\nrate should help bring down the overall cost of\nborrowing over the long term\nIn our view, the authorities want to contain credit risks in the property market without undermining broader efforts to spur a slowing economy. There have also been concerns that high property prices would be reducing consumer spending, which top officials hope would support growth\nAverage new home prices in the country’s 70 major cities advanced 0.6% in July from the previous month, making it the 51 st consecutive monthly gain, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The data show nationwide property prices rose 9.7% on a year on year basis in July, the slowest growth this year, moderating from a 10.3% gain in June.\nHowever, overall sales of residential property projects remain sluggish, prompting developers to cut prices. In the first seven months, growth in residential projects contracted 0.4%, compared with a 1 % decline in the first six months\nUnder the current tighter credit environment, we expect sales growth will continue to weaken for the rest of the year . We reiterate our view that the growth in nationwide gross floor area sold could fall by single to low double digits this year while overall property prices stay largely unchanged.\nBenchmark reform\nAs for ordinary homebuyers, the introduction in August of a new benchmark interest rate by the People’s Bank of China will start to have a gradual impact on mortgage payments made each month.\nAccording to PBoC Governor Yi Gang, the government wants to maintain stability in the property market and will ensure that the cost of household mortgages will remain largely stable a bid to push down the cost of borrowing without further inflating property prices\nThe PBoC on August 17 revamped its tool kit with a new benchmark interest rate. The loan prime rate, or LPR, has become the reference rate for banks pricing corporate loans and household mortgages.\nTo be announced monthly, the LPR pricing will take the arithmetic average of what a group of designated banks charge their clients, expressed as the spread over the one year medium term lending facility ( MLF). The MLF is a rate at which commercial banks borrow from the central bank, and is viewed as a better indication of the latest credit conditions.\nOn August 20, the PBoC set the one year LPR at 4.25% and the five year rate at 4.85 %. Those rates will be used as the benchmark for long term loans such as household mortgages. The new one year LPR was down 6bps from 4.31% previously. It was also 10bps lower than the previous benchmark one year lending rate of 4.35\nEffective from October 8, the interest rate on individual mortgages for first time homebuyers cannot be lower than the five year LPR, and the rate on loans for second time homebuyers cannot be lower than the LPR plus 60bps, according to the PBoC. Payments on outstanding mortgage loans remain unchanged\nGiven the minimal difference between the new and old lending rates, we think the impact on the mortgage market will take some time to be felt. In the longer term, the premium over the LPR should better reflect each bank’s lending appetite and its own assessment of credit risks, helping develop a market driven pricing mechanism\nIn theory, the introduction of the LPR should lower the overall funding cost and improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, eventually benefiting the country’s small and medium sized companies, which have limited access to the banking system\nAny forecast, projection or target contained in this presentation is for information purposes only and is not guaranteed in any way. HSBC accepts no liability for any failure to meet such forecasts, projections or targets.\nEquity market\nMSCI in late August increased the inclusion factor of China’s A shares to 15% from 10%, which will likely spur further inflows to the onshore market\nMSCI China and the onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index retreated in the month of August, raising concerns that the latest round of trade escalation between the US and China poses a heightened threat to global growth. As of 26 th August, the former and latter fell 6% and 5.3% (USD terms) on a monthly basis, respectively\nOn August 23, President Donald Trump said the US would lift tariffs on USD250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% with effect from October 1, and increase the levy on the remaining USD300 billion of imports from China, which include clothing and footwear, to 15% from 10%. The second tariff rate increase will take effect in two stages, on September 1 and December 1\nOn a brighter note, the US President on 26 th of August predicted a trade deal with China after positive gestures by Beijing, helping calm markets that have been roiled by the new rounds of tariffs\nThe US was responding to Beijing’s decision earlier to impose additional tariffs, ranging from 5% to 10%, on USD75 billion of US goods that include soybeans and frozen pork. Beijing’s retaliatory move was a response to the US decision earlier in August to impose a 10% tariff on USD300 billion worth of Chinese imports from September, before Washington said it would delay imposing duties on about half of those China made products until mid December\nIn other key macro data, the growth in industrial output a broad measure of manufacturing production rose 4.8% in July, its weakest rate since February 2002. Retail sales expanded by 7.6% in July, their weakest rate since April\nOn a month to date basis, only two of the 11 sectors included in MSCI China in August advanced, with companies in the healthcare and consumer staple rising 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Conversely, energy and communication services retreated 11.2% and 8.3%, reflecting concerns over an economic slowdown and a selloff in telecom companies\nFund flows into China’s A share market through the Stock Connect reversed in August, with net selling of USD640 million of shares, while net purchases of Hong Kong shares advanced for a sixth consecutive month, with net purchases of USD6.6 billion of shares. Meanwhile, MSCI’s schedule to raise the inclusion factor for A shares to 15% from 10% after the close of markets on August 27 is expected to draw USD4.5 billion of passive net inflows\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC Global Asset Management, as of 26 August 2019.

Germany, for instance, sold 30 year bonds with a negative yield for the first time, a milestone for the fixed income market where the entire yield curve yields less than zero\nIn China, the yield curve of government bonds remained largely unchanged in August, but the yield on benchmark 10 year bonds dipped below the 3% mark for the first time on August 15. The yield was hovering around 3% by late August\nForeign holding of Chinese bonds topped RMB2 trillion for the first time in July, according to data compiled by clearing houses China Central Depository and Clearing and Shanghai Clearing House. Foreign interest in Chinese bonds is partly driven by Bloomberg Barclays’s decision to begin adding Chinese government and policy bank bonds, as well as worries over prolonged trade discussions between the US and China\nOnshore and offshore renminbi bonds advanced 0.83% and 0.34% in August (up to the 26th), respectively, joining the big global rally in sovereign bonds. Currently, investors still expect further loosening measures by Beijing, after the latest set of weak economic data strengthened the case for further monetary easing\nThe July data on new loans came in lower than expectations, while the growth in money supply and total social financing (TSF) also moderated. Chinese banks extended RMB1.06 trillion in net loans in July, down from RMB1.66 trillion in June and falling short of expectations. The broadest measure of money supply, M2, expanded 8.1% year on year in July, down from an 8.5% increase in June. Growth in TSF softened to 10.7% from 10.9% over the same period\nUS China trade tensions escalated in August as both sides raised the tariffs modestly and rhetoric considerably. On the 23 rd , the US ordered American companies to find alternatives to China and dialled up tariffs after China applied duties on USD75 billion of US imports. To be sure, escalated tariffs could point to more depreciation pressure on the renminbi , but authorities may believe that a prolonged depreciation path does not seem to be in the best interests of the economy either\nGoing forward, we favour government and policy bank papers on the back of expectations that interest rates would be lower for longer, while remaining constructive on a few high beta names that should benefit from further easing measures\nSource: Bloomberg, Markit data as of 26 August 2019 .
